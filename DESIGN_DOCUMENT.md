# ATS System with AI Interviewer - Design Document

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the design of an intelligent Applicant Tracking System (ATS) that leverages AI to conduct automated interviews, generate relevant questions from job descriptions, analyze resumes, and create detailed scoring rubrics for candidate evaluation.

## 2. System Overview

The ATS AI Interviewer system automatically:
- Parses job descriptions to extract key requirements
- Analyzes candidate resumes to identify relevant experience
- Generates personalized interview questions based on JD and resume
- Conducts interactive AI-driven interviews
- Creates detailed evaluation rubrics
- Scores candidates quantitatively with detailed justifications

## 3. Core Components

### 3.1 Job Description Analyzer
**Purpose**: Extract structured information from job descriptions

**Logic**:
1. Parse raw job description text
2. Extract key elements:
   - Required skills (technical & soft skills)
   - Years of experience required
   - Educational qualifications
   - Responsibilities and duties
   - Nice-to-have skills
   - Company culture indicators
3. Categorize requirements by priority (must-have vs nice-to-have)
4. Generate competency framework
5. Store structured JD in database

**Output**: Structured JD object with weighted competencies

### 3.2 Resume Parser & Analyzer
**Purpose**: Extract and structure candidate information from resumes

**Logic**:
1. Accept resume in multiple formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT)
2. Use OCR and NLP to extract:
   - Personal information
   - Work experience (companies, roles, duration, responsibilities)
   - Educational background
   - Skills and certifications
   - Projects and achievements
3. Calculate experience metrics:
   - Total years of experience
   - Years in relevant roles
   - Skill proficiency indicators (frequency of mention, context)
4. Match resume against JD requirements:
   - Calculate skill overlap percentage
   - Identify gaps
   - Find unique strengths
5. Generate candidate profile summary

**Output**: Structured candidate profile with JD-match score

### 3.3 Question Generation Engine
**Purpose**: Generate relevant, contextual interview questions

**Logic**:
1. Input: Structured JD + Candidate Profile
2. Question Generation Strategy:
   
   **A. Coverage-based Questions** (60% of questions)
   - For each required skill in JD:
     - If present in resume: Generate deep-dive/validation questions
     - If absent in resume: Generate screening questions
   - Example: JD requires "Python", resume mentions "Python Django"
     → Generate: "Describe your experience with Python's async/await patterns in Django"
   
   **B. Experience-based Questions** (25% of questions)
   - Analyze candidate's work history
   - Generate behavioral questions based on their specific projects
   - Example: Resume mentions "Led team of 5"
     → Generate: "Tell me about a conflict you resolved while leading your team at [Company]"
   
   **C. Scenario-based Questions** (15% of questions)
   - Create hypothetical scenarios based on JD responsibilities
   - Test problem-solving and critical thinking
   - Example: JD mentions "Scaling microservices"
     → Generate: "How would you approach migrating a monolithic application to microservices?"

3. Question Difficulty Calibration:
   - Match difficulty to experience level
   - Start with moderate difficulty
   - Adapt based on previous answers

4. Question Diversity:
   - Technical knowledge questions
   - Behavioral/STAR format questions
   - Problem-solving scenarios
   - Culture fit questions

**Output**: Prioritized list of 15-25 interview questions with expected answer patterns

### 3.4 AI Interview Conductor
**Purpose**: Conduct interactive, conversational interviews

**Logic**:
1. **Interview Flow**:
   ```
   Start → Welcome & Context Setting → Main Interview → Candidate Questions → Closing
   ```

2. **Conversation Management**:
   - Present questions one at a time
   - Use natural language understanding to:
     - Detect when candidate has finished answering
     - Identify if answer is complete or needs follow-up
     - Recognize relevant vs tangential responses
   
3. **Dynamic Follow-up Logic**:
   - If answer is incomplete → Ask clarifying questions
   - If answer is vague → Request specific examples
   - If answer reveals interesting experience → Deep dive with follow-up
   - If answer is strong → Move to next topic
   - If answer is weak → Probe understanding or move on

4. **Adaptive Interviewing**:
   - Real-time adjustment of question difficulty
   - Skip redundant questions if already answered
   - Add bonus questions for exceptional candidates
   - Allow for conversational tangents when relevant

5. **Interview Recording**:
   - Store complete transcript
   - Tag each answer with question ID
   - Record timestamps and metadata
   - Capture candidate tone/sentiment (optional)

**Output**: Complete interview transcript with structured Q&A pairs

### 3.5 Rubric Generator
**Purpose**: Create detailed, job-specific scoring rubrics

**Logic**:
1. **Rubric Structure Creation**:
   - Identify evaluation dimensions from JD:
     - Technical Skills (broken down by specific skill)
     - Experience & Background
     - Problem-solving Ability
     - Communication Skills
     - Cultural Fit
     - Leadership/Teamwork
   
2. **Dimension Weighting**:
   - Assign weights based on JD importance:
     - Senior role → Higher weight on leadership
     - Technical role → Higher weight on technical skills
     - Junior role → Higher weight on learning ability
   
3. **Scoring Criteria Definition**:
   For each dimension, define 5-level scale:
   - **Level 1 (0-20%)**: Below expectations
     - Specific indicators of poor performance
   - **Level 2 (21-40%)**: Needs improvement
     - Indicators of basic but insufficient knowledge
   - **Level 3 (41-60%)**: Meets expectations
     - Indicators of satisfactory performance
   - **Level 4 (61-80%)**: Exceeds expectations
     - Indicators of strong performance
   - **Level 5 (81-100%)**: Exceptional
     - Indicators of outstanding performance

4. **Evidence Requirements**:
   - Define what constitutes evidence for each level
   - Link questions to rubric dimensions
   - Specify answer patterns for each score level

**Example Rubric Entry**:
```
Dimension: Python Programming (Weight: 20%)
Questions: Q3, Q7, Q12

Level 5 (81-100%): 
- Demonstrates deep understanding of advanced concepts (decorators, metaclasses, async)
- Provides specific examples of complex implementations
- Discusses trade-offs and best practices
- Shows awareness of Python internals

Level 4 (61-80%):
- Solid understanding of core concepts (OOP, data structures)
- Can explain practical applications
- Mentions some best practices
- Shows good problem-solving with Python

[... continued for each level]
```

**Output**: Comprehensive, weighted rubric with detailed scoring criteria

### 3.6 Answer Evaluator & Scorer
**Purpose**: Score candidate responses against rubric

**Logic**:
1. **Answer Analysis**:
   For each answer:
   - Extract key points and claims
   - Identify technical terms and concepts mentioned
   - Analyze structure (STAR format for behavioral questions)
   - Assess completeness and relevance
   - Check for specificity vs vagueness

2. **Rubric Mapping**:
   - Match each answer to relevant rubric dimensions
   - Some answers may contribute to multiple dimensions
   - Weight contribution based on question importance

3. **Scoring Algorithm**:
   For each rubric dimension:
   ```
   a. Collect all answers relevant to this dimension
   b. For each answer, determine which level it satisfies
   c. Generate evidence list (quotes from answers)
   d. Calculate dimension score:
      - Primary method: Highest level consistently demonstrated
      - Consider consistency across multiple questions
      - Penalize contradictions or inconsistencies
   e. Apply confidence factor (more questions = higher confidence)
   ```

4. **Evidence Generation**:
   - Extract specific quotes supporting each score
   - Link back to original questions and answers
   - Provide reasoning for score assignment

5. **Overall Score Calculation**:
   ```
   Overall Score = Σ (Dimension_Score × Dimension_Weight)
   ```

6. **Detailed Feedback Generation**:
   - Strengths: Top-performing dimensions with evidence
   - Areas for improvement: Low-scoring dimensions with specific gaps
   - Notable highlights: Exceptional answers or unique qualifications
   - Red flags: Concerning responses or major skill gaps

**Output**: 
- Numerical score (0-100) for each dimension
- Overall weighted score
- Detailed evidence-based justification
- Structured feedback report

## 7. Scoring Algorithm Details

### 7.1 Dimension Score Calculation

```python
def calculate_dimension_score(dimension, relevant_answers, rubric_criteria):
    """
    Calculate score for a single rubric dimension
    """
    scores = []
    evidence = []
    
    for answer in relevant_answers:
        # Use LLM to evaluate answer against criteria
        evaluation = llm_evaluate(
            question=answer.question,
            response=answer.text,
            criteria=rubric_criteria
        )
        
        scores.append(evaluation.score)
        evidence.extend(evaluation.evidence)
    
    # Calculate final dimension score
    if len(scores) == 1:
        final_score = scores[0]
        confidence = 0.7  # Lower confidence with single data point
    else:
        # Use weighted average, giving more weight to consistent performance
        final_score = calculate_weighted_average(scores)
        confidence = calculate_consistency_confidence(scores)
    
    return {
        'score': final_score,
        'confidence': confidence,
        'evidence': evidence,
        'individual_scores': scores
    }
```

### 7.2 Overall Score Calculation

```python
def calculate_overall_score(dimension_scores, rubric):
    """
    Calculate weighted overall score
    """
    total_score = 0
    total_weight = 0
    
    for dimension in rubric.dimensions:
        dim_result = dimension_scores[dimension.id]
        weighted_score = dim_result.score * dimension.weight * dim_result.confidence
        total_score += weighted_score
        total_weight += dimension.weight * dim_result.confidence
    
    # Normalize by total weight
    overall_score = (total_score / total_weight) if total_weight > 0 else 0
    
    return round(overall_score, 2)
